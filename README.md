<b>Discover your browsing habits! Time tracking at its best.</b>

## Problems

It is near to impossible for a chrome user to keep his/her browsing habits in track. 
<ul>
  <li><b>The Google Chrome Browser</b> does not let its users to view their uptime on a single or multiple webpages.</li>
    <li>It also does not provide its users with any kind of browsing stats like most active day, or most inactive day of a user.</li>
      <li>There is also no visual representation like <b>Graphs</b> and <b>Pie Charts</b> of the user's browsing time data.</li>
</ul>

## Solution

So my approach to solve this above problem is by making a <b>Google Chrome Extension</b> named <b>"Time Keep"</b> which allows Chrome Users to keep track of time spent on specific webpages and also visually representing the data with Bar Diagram and Pie Charts. Also allowing the users to take screenshot of their stats or export the stats.


## Features

<ul>
  <li>Time spent on the present opened tab is shown on the Extension icon
  <img src="" alt=""></li>
</ul>
